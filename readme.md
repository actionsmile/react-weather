This app is just an example of usage [React](https://wwww.reactjs.org), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) power. It uses [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com) as a data-provider, so you can learn how to use external services, Promises and so onâ€¦

## Installation
All you need to do is just:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/actionsmile/react-weather.git
cd react-weather
npm i
npm start
```

But I prefer `yarn` instead.

I supose, that you have `npm` and `node` installed.
